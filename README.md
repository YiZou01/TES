## Introduction

This is the R script for functions of ES(), TES() and plot.TES(). This repo serves as the supplement for Zou, Y., Zhao, P., & Axmacher, J. C. (2023). Estimating total species richness: Fitting rarefaction by asymptotic approximation. Ecosphere, 14(1), e4363. doi: 10.1002/ecs2.4363.

## Functions 

**Functions.R** provides the following functions:

- `ES()` calculate the Expected Species
- `TES()` calculate Total Expected Species base on ESa, ESb and their average value
- `plot.TES()` provides the fitted curve for TES
